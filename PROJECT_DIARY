Foreword
We all know he technical documentation stuff like changelogs, part lists, readmes and so on. While it is really important to have this stuff, it often lacks information on the reasons behind a project-, design- or tool decision.
Thus I decided make a "PROJECT DIARY", where I want to write down the thoughts behind all those small and big decisions and development steps.

It wasn't an easy decision to switch from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD for modeling all the mechanical stuff. While I was able to do quite complex parametrical modeling with OpenSCAD, I struggled a bit when it came down to adding new features to a already complex part.
Thus, I picked up the recommendation from a friend, trying FreeCAD (Thanks, Ralph!). It took me some days to figure out, how I can design/model in an efficient way, but now I am confident, it's a good decision to switch over to FreeCAD.
I already managed to re-model the basic shutter mechanics (shutter blades, shutter body, curve ring, motor gear), but there's still a lot to learn...
