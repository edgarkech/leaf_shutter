Some hints about the scripting and according conventions in here - as my OpenSCAD scripting is learning by doing, some constructs may look crude or even violate best practice.
I am using some rules and conventions to make my scripting as consistent, readable and maintainable as possible.

General logic for getting this design parametric:
- baseconfig.scad holds very generic configuration values which are independent of the targeted camera format. But it also includes the format specific config file.
- config_4x5.scad/config_5x7.scad/config_8x10.scad are the format specific configuration files. Here we set some basic, format specific variables from which we can derive lots of measures for our design
- all other scad files are including the baseconfig.scad file to get all basic and format dependent variables for deriving the specific measures

Naming conventions
- all Variables are prefixed with "v"
- all Variables are (somehow) speaking, eg. vFrontLidOuter_l
- suffix _l is typically a measure in x direction
- suffix _w is typically a measure in y direction
- suffix _h is typically a measure in z direction
- suffix _d/_d1/_d2 are typically a diameter variables
- suffix _r/_r1/_r2 are typically radius variables 
- suffix _offsetX/_offsetY/_offsetZ are offset variables to be used in translate() statements
- every basic element has its own set of l/w/h/d/r variables
- every element will have its own set of offset variables

Other conventions
- mathematic operations are done within the variables. 
- most parts are symetric, so we center them on the X axis
- try to keep the scripting readable
