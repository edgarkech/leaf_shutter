Printed parts

All parts can be printed on any decent 3D printer with sufficient build volume
Print settings vary slightly for the different parts - if not explicitly mentioned, I am using
- 0.2mm layers or better
- 4 walls
- 4 bottom/top layers
- when printing with PETG, use at least 15-20% more infill as hinted below, below numbers are for PLA
