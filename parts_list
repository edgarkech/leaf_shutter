Printed parts

All parts can be printed on any decent 3D printer with sufficient build volume 
- for 4x5" a smaller printer with about 190x190x100mm build volume is sufficient
- for 5x7" a build volume of at least 235x235x100mm is required
- for 8x10" a build volume of at least 300x300x120mm is required

Print settings vary slightly for the different parts - if not explicitly mentioned use
- 0.2mm layers or better
- 4 walls
- 4 bottom/top layers
- when printing with PETG, use at least 15-20% more infill as hinted below, below numbers are for PLA
The tolerances between the parts are quite tight, so you have to sand them. I recommend sanding the dovetail parts with 400 wet sanding paper.
